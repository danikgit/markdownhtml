    <p>Hi! I am a new student at Tech Bridge from North Carolina. I have a background in IT as a helpdesk analyst. I am excited about this new opportunity, and it has given me a drive to learn even more about coding. Being exposed to this knowledge in such detail has made me want to pursue being a software engineer with even more excitement, because there is so much that you can do as a software creator. Websites, mobile apps, games, the possibilities are endless!
